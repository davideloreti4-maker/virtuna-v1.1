## The system in one line
Flat-warm **charcoal** surfaces + **cream** text + a **terracotta accent used sparingly** +
**matte** depth (no glass gradients, no glow, no white inset-shine). Primary actions are
**neutral cream**, not accent. Inter for all chrome; serif **only** for voice-moments
(greeting/hero). The old cold-black `#07080a` Raycast glass system is dead. The de-Claude
break is the **near-zero dosage**, not the hue — so as of **2026-06-24** the accent hue is
**terracotta `#d97757`** (signal-red `#e23b2d` was trialed and reverted; dosage rule kept). See
**"Accent dosage (LOCKED)"** below.

## Tokens (real values — `globals.css`)

### Color
| Role | Token | Value |
|---|---|---|
| App background | `--color-background` / `--charcoal-app` | `#262624` (warm charcoal) |
| Sidebar | `--charcoal-sidebar` | `#1a1a18` |
| Composer surface | `--charcoal-composer` | `#1e1d1b` |
| Chip / lifted | `--charcoal-chip` | `#2f2e2b` |
| Primary text | `--cream-primary` | `#ece7de` (**never `#fff`**) |
| Secondary text | `--cream-secondary` | `#c2bdb4` |
| Muted text | `--cream-muted` | `#8a857c` |
| Accent (solid) | `--coral-500` / `--color-accent` | `#d97757` terracotta/clay — the brand accent (**not legacy `#FF7F50`**) |
| Accent (text/icon) | `--color-accent-text` / `--coral-400` | terracotta, legible on dark |
| Accent soft (tint bg) | `--color-accent-soft` | `oklch(0.68 0.13 33 / 0.16)` (terracotta tint) |
| Accent foreground | `--color-accent-foreground` | `#f6e9e6` (cream glyph on solid accent) |
| **Primary action** | `--color-action` | `#ece7de` cream — buttons/send are NEUTRAL, not accent |
| Action foreground | `--color-action-foreground` | `#1c1b19` (dark glyph on cream) |

### Border / depth
- Borders: `rgba(255,255,255,0.06)`, hover `rgba(255,255,255,0.1)`. (6% / 10% — unchanged from before.)
- **Matte, not glass.** Glass 137° gradients, radial halos, white inset-shine, coral glow are all **REMOVED** and stay banned.
- **Depth is a soft DARK drop-shadow — never light, never glow.** This is the one lever the Hybrid elevation pass added (2026-07-05): cards are no longer flat, but the depth is monochrome (black-alpha drops with a vertical offset), so near-zero accent is untouched. The distinction the guard enforces: a matte drop has a **non-zero Y offset** (`0 10px 26px …`); a banned glow is a **zero-offset halo** (`0 0 Npx`).

### Matte depth scale (Hybrid elevation — LOCKED 2026-07-05)
A three-step resting/interactive scale plus the pre-existing float, all soft dark drops:

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--shadow-rest` | `0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.28)` | Card **floor** — resting elevation on every elevated card |
| `--shadow-lift` | `0 10px 26px -8px rgba(0,0,0,.5)` | **Hover raise** — tight matte; negative spread keeps it under the card, no bloom |
| `--shadow-press` | `0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.3)` | **Press settle** — collapses back toward the floor |
| `--shadow-float` | `0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,.35)` | Genuinely **floating** chrome only (composer, popovers) — unchanged |

**Consume via utilities, don't hand-roll the shadows:**
- `.elev-rest` — resting floor only, for elevated-but-**static** cards (stat tiles, calendar day cells).
- `.elev-lift` — **interactive** cards: floor at rest → −1px lift + `--shadow-lift` on hover → settle + `--shadow-press` on `:active`. Ships the shared 150ms transition (see Motion).

Pair `.elev-lift` with colour feedback in Tailwind (`hover:border-white/[0.10] hover:bg-white/[0.03]`) — the utility's transition animates those props too, so surfaces get smooth feedback for free. Depth stays monochrome; the hover **border/bg brighten is neutral white-alpha, never accent**.

### Motion
Motion is **calm and physical** — short, eased, purposeful; it confirms an action or reveals content, never decorates. Reduced-motion is a first-class state: every animation has a `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` branch that snaps to rest.

**Tokens (`globals.css` `@theme`):**
- Durations: `--duration-fast: 150ms` (hover/press feedback), `--duration-normal: 200ms` (state changes), `--duration-slow: 300ms` (larger transitions).
- Easings: `--ease-out` (`cubic-bezier(0.215,0.61,0.355,1)` — the default for entrances/lifts), `--ease-out-quart`, `--ease-in-out`, `--ease-spring` (reserve for the rare sanctioned bounce, e.g. a liveness badge-pop).

**The interaction patterns:**
- **Hover-lift / press-settle** — `.elev-lift` (above). 150ms `--ease-out`; lift −1px, settle to 0. This is the standard for any clickable card.
- **Entrance** — `.rv-in` (`juno-fade-up`, 0.55s): staggered fade-up on first paint. The shared surface reveal; stagger children, not the sticky container.
- **Liveness** — `constell-dot` breathe / `badge-pop` (the one sanctioned accent-fill, a genuine liveness event only). Motion + tone, never coral chrome.

**Rules:** never animate `width`/`height`/`top`/`left` (layout thrash) — use `transform`/`opacity`/`box-shadow`. No infinite non-liveness loops. No bounce except `--ease-spring` on a real liveness moment. Every hover/entrance must degrade under reduced-motion.

### Surface sectioning (zones)
Group a surface's content into discrete **matte tone-zones** — NOT a diffuse background glow.
(The `SURFACE_RADIAL_BG` top-glow was retired from `/start` in the elevation pass: a faint
radial reads as low-fidelity, not premium. Prefer discrete zones.) A zone is a subtle
lighter-charcoal panel that chunks a section's cards:
- **Fill:** a hair lighter than the page bg — `#252320` over the `#1f1f1e` app bg (~1 tone-step).
- **Shape:** `rounded-2xl`, generous padding (`px-4 py-4`), **no border, no shadow.** The tone +
  padding do the grouping; the inner cards keep their own borders + `.elev-*` depth and pop
  against the zone (avoids the double-border / stacked-shadow busyness).
- **Rhythm:** a consistent `mt-4` between stacked zones.

This gives the "lit sections" effect (cf. Stanley's glow-sectioning) with matte tone instead of
glow, and mirrors how a card-based right rail already reads as sections. The human header
(greeting) floats **above** the zones, unzoned. Reference impl: `start-page.tsx` (Numbers ·
Daily ideas · Outliers zones). Any at-a-glance chrome (e.g. the progress rings) belongs anchored
to its content (beside the greeting), not floating as a top-center band.

### Type
- Sans: `--font-inter` — all UI chrome, all weights.
- Serif: `--font-serif` — **voice-moments ONLY** (greeting line, hero). Never body/chrome.
  Currently wired to **Newsreader**. Candidate swap → **Fraunces** (more optical character,
  further from Claude's serif feel). Swapping requires `next/font` wiring in the root layout
  — until then `--font-serif` stays Newsreader. Tracked as a follow-up, not blocking.

### Radius scale
`4 / 6 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 24` px. Cards 12, inputs/buttons 8, header 16, modals 12.

## Accent dosage (LOCKED 2026-06-24)
**Monochrome by default. Accent is the rare exception — used REALLY sparingly, if at all.**
The UI is cream-on-charcoal; color is not a styling tool. This is the rule that separates us from
Claude (which floods its terracotta everywhere). Goal posture: a screen with **zero** accent is the
norm, not a failure. Pattern is the quiet end of Linear / Vercel / Whop.

**Default = NO accent.** Every accent use must be *justified* and is opt-in, not a default. If you
can't name the specific high-meaning reason, it gets none. Aim for **at most one** accent element
visible on a screen at a time; often zero.

**The only sanctioned uses (and even these are optional):**
- The single live "presence/liveness" signal (e.g. the audience "personas ready" dot) — one per view
- The lit node in the constellation / SIM mark
- The brand mark / logo itself
- (Active-state ticks, selection, focus → prefer NEUTRAL; do not reach for accent here)

**Accent is NEVER allowed on:**
- Primary buttons / the composer send → `--color-action` (neutral cream)
- Icon buttons, skill pills, chevrons, placeholders, tabs, toggles → cream / muted
- Links, borders, large fills, hover states, charts, badges, progress — all neutral
- Anything "to make it pop" — that instinct is the thing we are removing

**Why this hard line:** at near-zero dosage the *hue* barely registers, so the Claude
resemblance dies on any color — this is why the hue itself (terracotta vs red) is not the
de-Claude lever; the dosage is. `--color-error` stays reserved for genuine destructive/error
states; accent ≠ error, never conflated.

**Emphasis without color:** weight, *italic* (serif voice-moments), size, spacing, and hierarchy —
never paint.

**Identity load-bearing parts** (the brand lives here, since color is essentially absent): the
**constellation / SIM motif**, the **serif voice**, copy, and layout. Invest there — that is where
distinctiveness comes from, not the accent.

## Brand mark & naming (updated 2026-07-07)

**The mark is the Maven gull** — a single bird in flight drawn as one tapered ink-brush
stroke (wings arched up, tips swept out, a soft dip at the body). **Monochrome, no color** —
one closed path filled with `currentColor`, so it inherits the surrounding text color on any
ground (cream on charcoal, charcoal on cream). It replaces the retired **stele "n"** mark.

- **Component:** `src/components/brand/maven-logo.tsx` → `<MavenMark size />` (bare mark,
  sidebar/favicon) and `<MavenLogo />` (mark + **"Maven"** wordmark, Inter, sentence-case).
- **Standalone assets:** `public/brand/maven-mark.svg` (charcoal `#1c1b19`, for light grounds)
  and `public/brand/maven-mark-light.svg` (cream `#ece7de`, for dark grounds).
- **Favicons:** `src/app/icon.svg` and `src/app/apple-icon.svg` — the gull in cream on a
  charcoal `#262624` tile (self-contained so it reads on any browser chrome).
- **Path (locked):** `M34 66 Q50 30 84 24 Q106 20 120 48 Q134 20 156 24 Q190 30 206 66 Q192 38
  158 34 Q138 32 120 58 Q102 32 82 34 Q48 38 34 66 Z` on `viewBox="0 0 240 96"`.

**Naming boundary (house of brands):** **Maven** is the creator app (the product name users
see — chrome, marketing, SEO/OG titles, the wordmark). **Numen Machines** is the company (it
signs the footer `© … Numen Machines` and stays). The engine/model is **Anima**. So a
Numen→Maven rename is *not* a blind find-replace: product strings → Maven; the company name,
the internal `NumenTier` billing type, engine/system-prompt internals (e.g. the "Numen
co-pilot" voice), and the `numen.*` localStorage keys deliberately stay Numen.

## Hard rules (the guard test enforces these)
`src/components/reading/__tests__/reskin-matte.test.ts` asserts NO coral-glow / NO glass in
reading components — keep it green. Generally:
1. No `#fff` text → use `--cream-primary`.
2. No `#FF7F50` / `#07080a` / `#18191a` (dead Raycast literals).
3. No glass gradients, no glow halo (`0 0 Npx`), no inset white-shine, no coral. Matte **dark** drop-shadows via the depth scale (`--shadow-rest`/`lift`/`press`/`float`, always with a vertical offset) ARE allowed — that is the Hybrid elevation lever.
4. Consume tokens, never hardcode hex. (Known offenders to migrate: `saved-item-card.tsx:234,252`, `error.tsx`, `opengraph-image.tsx`.)

## Component map (target UI surfaces)
| Surface | Location |
|---|---|
| Ambient audience / AudienceLens | `src/components/audience-lens/` (`AudienceLens.tsx`, `audience-presence.tsx`, `PopulationSwarm.tsx`) |
| Audience creation flow | `src/components/audience/` (`audience-form`, `calibration-flow`, `persona-edit-form`); routes `src/app/(app)/audience/*` |
| Library page | route `src/app/(app)/library/page.tsx`; cards `src/components/saved/` |
| Skills UI / thread cards | `src/components/thread/` (`message-blocks.tsx` dispatcher + `*-card-block.tsx`); reading `src/components/reading/` |
| Composer | `src/components/app/home/composer.tsx` + `composer-controls.tsx` |

## Follow-up (stale-doc cleanup — not blocking)
`CLAUDE.md` branding line + "Raycast Design Language Rules" section are wrong and should be
replaced with a pointer here. `BRAND-BIBLE.md` + `docs/tokens.md` etc. should be regenerated
from `globals.css` or deleted. Tracked, not yet done.
