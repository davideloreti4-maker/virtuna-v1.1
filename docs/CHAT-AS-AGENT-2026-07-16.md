# Chat as a skill-orchestrating agent — the "one thread, all skills" vision (2026-07-16)

**Status:** dispatcher spike PASSED (routing 5/5 + a real ideas run) **AND route integration WIRED**
(flag `CHAT_AGENT_DISPATCH`, default OFF) — a chat turn now runs a skill and its real cards render in
the same thread. **Branch:** `spike/corpus-fn-tool`. **Builds on:**
`docs/SPIKE-CORPUS-FN-TOOL-2026-07-16.md` (function calling proven with qwen3.7-plus).

> **▶ START HERE (next session).** Route integration is DONE at three layers and proven by tests (§4a);
> what's left is the REACH work (§4b): (1) **reload fidelity** — live streaming shows dispatched cards
> in the chat view, but on reload the composer segregates persisted blocks by type + restores
> `activeTool`, so a chat-run ideas set reappears in the IDEAS view, not chat. True "one thread on
> reload" needs a unified persisted-block render (stop segregating by tool). (2) **Generalize beyond
> generators** — simulate/predict/read/profile need a concept/analysis context, not just a topic; add a
> SECOND adapter shape to `SKILL_TOOLS` (do NOT force them through the generator adapter). (3) **Light
> attribution** in general chat (owner decision, still unwired). Then the product call: retire the skill
> selector (keep it until the flag-on path is proven in prod). **Not yet run:** a full flag-on browser
> session against live DashScope+Supabase (owner-auth-gated; the dispatcher itself is already
> live-proven, and the new plumbing is deterministic + test-covered). Live scripts: **sandbox-OFF,
> foreground** (`npx tsx …`). Tests: `node ./node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run …` (NOT `npm test`).

## 0. The vision (owner)

One surface. You chat, ask for ideas, then hooks on the best one, then a script — **all in the same
thread**, so context carries the whole way, and you **never manually pick a skill**. The skill
*selector* becomes optional.

## 1. The discovery — the vision is ~80% already built

The app is **already a unified block-message thread**:

- Every message row is `{ role, blocks[] }`; the **BLOCK_REGISTRY** already has a type for every skill's
  output (`markdown`, `idea-card`, `hook-card`, `script-card`, `remix-card`, `outlier-grid`,
  `multi-audience-read`, `prediction-gauge`, `persona-chat-turn`, …), validated on write + rehydration.
- **Every skill route** (`/api/tools/{hooks,ideas,simulate,script,…}`) already runs its pipeline and
  `insertMessage(openThread.id, "assistant", blocks)` into the **SAME open thread** ("Hooks chain
  appends to the same open thread as Ideas").
- The thread already renders all of it (`src/components/thread/message-blocks.tsx`).
- Conversational glue already exists: after a hooks run, the route makes a co-pilot Qwen call that
  writes an observation + a next step, persisted as a markdown message in the same thread.

So the make-or-break "inline card rendering / shared context" is **already the shipping architecture**.
The skill selector is just a UI convenience picking which route the composer POSTs to — they all write
to the same thread. **The only missing piece: chat doesn't DISPATCH to the other skills.**

## 2. What was built — the dispatcher (spike)

`src/lib/tools/skill-dispatch.ts` — chat-as-agent, **general by construction**:

- A **skill-tool registry** (`SKILL_TOOLS`): each skill = one entry (tool schema + a thin adapter to its
  `runXPipeline`). The three generators share one input shape, so the adapter is uniform. Adding a skill
  is one entry.
- `runSkillDispatch({ ask, context })`: gives the chat model the toolbelt, `tool_choice: "auto"`; the
  model either answers (pure chat) or calls a skill; we run its pipeline and collect the block-cards +
  a closing co-pilot line. Returns `{ text, skillRuns: [{name, blocks}], toolCalls }`.
- **PAID-ENGINE LEASH** (`maxSkillRuns`, default 2): skills hit the paid engine; over the cap the tool
  returns a refusal the model relays instead of running. An LLM spending money needs a limit.
- Unknown-skill / empty-topic / run-error are all absorbed into tool results (never throw).

## 3. Spike results (live, real qwen3.7-plus)

**Routing — 5/5** (real model decides, mock runners → free):

| ask | dispatched to |
|---|---|
| "Give me 3 ideas for a video about morning routines" | ✅ `generate_ideas` |
| "Write me some hooks for a video on meal prep" | ✅ `generate_hooks` |
| "Write a full script for a video about budgeting tips" | ✅ `write_script` |
| "What actually makes a good hook these days?" | ✅ (none — chat) |
| "I'm stuck at 400 followers, what should I focus on?" | ✅ (none — chat) |

The closing text is the co-pilot voice and **chains skills**: *"I've generated 3 fresh angles… let me
know if one stands out, or if you'd like hooks for any of them."*

**Real run (`SPIKE_REAL=1`):** the dispatcher ran the real `runIdeasPipeline` → **4 real `idea-card`
blocks** (the exact type the thread renders) + *"Which one resonates, or would you like me to write a
script for one of them?"*

**Tests:** `src/lib/tools/__tests__/skill-dispatch.test.ts` — 6 hermetic (routing, abstain, leash,
unknown, no-topic, error). Green, tsc clean. Harness: `scripts/spike-skill-dispatch.ts`.

## 4a. Route integration — DONE (flag `CHAT_AGENT_DISPATCH`, default OFF)

Wired across three layers; 320 lines, +5 route tests + 2 new test files; 423 tests green in the touched
areas; tsc clean.

- **Server** (`src/app/api/tools/chat/route.ts`): open chat only (persona/meet EXCLUDED — a viewer
  reacts in-voice, it doesn't orchestrate skills; mirrors the corpus-tool exclusion). When the flag is
  on, the turn goes through `runSkillDispatch`. If a skill ran: each card streams as `event: block` +
  is `insertMessage`d into THIS thread; the co-pilot closing line streams as a `token` + persists as a
  markdown message; `stage` events ride the skill's real `onStage` boundaries. If NO skill ran (pure
  chat / strategy talk) → `dispatched` stays false and control falls through to the **existing grounded
  `runChatPipeline`**, so plain-chat quality is never degraded. Flag OFF → byte-identical.
- **Transport** (`src/hooks/queries/use-chat-stream.ts`): consumes `block` + `stage` into an ordered
  `streamingBlocks` / `stages`, alongside the existing token/meta/done/error handling.
- **Render** (`src/components/thread/chat-thread-view.tsx` + composer prop): the streamed cards render
  through the EXISTING `MessageBlocks` (a renderer per card type). New prop `streamingCardBlocks`.

Design notes:
- **Separate flag** `CHAT_AGENT_DISPATCH` (independent of `GROUNDING_CHAT_TOOL` — they're different
  levers). Read via `isChatAgentDispatchEnabled()`.
- I streamed a general **`event: block`** (the full validated card) rather than reusing the ideas
  route's `content`+`score` two-phase emit verbatim — that two-phase shape is generator-specific; a
  single block event is the GENERAL fit (band/fraction already on the block; honest one-shot render) and
  is the natural home for §4b's non-generator skills.
- **Pure-chat cost:** flag-on plain-chat turns make one thin dispatch-detection call before the grounded
  answer. Deliberate tradeoff (don't degrade grounded chat); optimizable later.
- The **paid-engine leash** stays (`runSkillDispatch`'s `maxSkillRuns`, default 2).

## 4b. What's left (the reach)

1. **Reload fidelity.** Live streaming shows the dispatched cards in the CHAT view, but the composer's
   rehydration (`loadPersistedBlocks`) splits persisted blocks by TYPE into per-tool buckets and
   restores `activeTool` to the last card type — so on reload a chat-run ideas set reappears in the
   IDEAS view, not chat. Full "one thread on reload" = a unified persisted-block render that stops
   segregating by tool (bigger composer refactor).
2. **Generalize beyond generators.** simulate/predict/read/profile need a concept/analysis context, not
   just a topic — a SECOND adapter shape in `SKILL_TOOLS`. Do NOT force them through the generator
   adapter. The `event: block` transport already generalizes; only the tool schema + adapter are new.
3. **Wire light attribution** in general chat (owner decision — §6 of the handoff).
4. **Product call:** retire the skill selector, or keep it as a shortcut. **Keep it until the flag-on
   path is proven in prod** — don't rip it out on faith.
5. **Live proof:** run the flag-on flow in a real browser session (DashScope+Supabase). Owner-auth-gated.

## 5. Guardrails (hold these)

- Paid-engine leash on every dispatch (done).
- Flag-gated; degrade to plain chat on any failure.
- Selector stays until the chat path is proven in prod.
