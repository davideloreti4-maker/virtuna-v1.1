# UI Surface: Skill output cards — refined design spec

> **Sibling doc — read it if you are touching `/home`:** `docs/subsystems/ui-home-composer.md`

## 0. Skills in scope

`/explore` · `/ideas` · `/hooks` · `/script` · `/remix` · `/chat` · `/test`, plus **Account Read** and the
flagship **video Read** (`/analyze`). The thread block types they render (SSOT `src/lib/tools/blocks.ts`):
`hook-card`, `idea-card`, `script-card`, `remix-card`, `multi-audience-read` (in-thread Read),
`account-read`, `outlier-grid` (Discover/Explore), `band` + `personas` (test output), `persona-chat-turn`,
`markdown`. The video Read is a separate renderer system (`src/components/reading/**`), NOT a thread block.

## 0.5 THE CARD CONTRACT (canon — 2026-07-13, `lane/explore-a`)

> **Read this before touching any card.** §1 below is the design *language* (tone, color, matte).
> This is the *structure* every card must satisfy. It is not new taste — it is the hook card
> (`hook-card-block.tsx`) written down, because that card is the bar and the others drifted from it.
> Cards drifted precisely because each was built alone with nothing to conform to. Conform to this.

**The spine, in order.** A card may omit a row it has no data for; it may not reorder them.

1. **Eyebrow** — quiet uppercase kicker + a 6px dot, left. One meta item right (rank, or the trust
   tier). Provenance does NOT go here.
2. **Hero** — the deliverable, `text-[17px] font-semibold`. The thing the user came for reads FIRST.
   If your card's payoff is a sentence, that sentence is the hero — not a label, not a name, not a
   score. (Profile Read had its payoff sitting third at body weight. That was the whole bug.)
3. **Receipt** (`<ProofReceipt>`) — when the output derives from a real video. See §0.5b.
4. **Why-teaser** — one clamped line of the mechanism.
5. **Proof unit** (`<ProofUnit>`) — band + fraction + lead quote + the visible "See the room →".
6. **ONE disclosure** — `<CaretToggle>` + "Why & details", with the model tag demoted onto that
   line (`· SIM-1 Flash`). Provenance is a footnote, never a headline. If you find yourself adding a
   second labelled section, put it in here instead.
7. **ONE action bar** — cream primary (`--color-action`, the forward chain step) + `<SaveAffordance
   className="ml-auto">`. Save is an icon in the bar, never a naked row of its own.

**Type + geometry.** Section labels are `text-[11px] uppercase tracking-[0.05em] text-foreground-muted`
— NOT `10px`/`0.14em` (that was the old stack). Radius comes from the **token scale
4/6/8/12/16/20/24** (`rounded-md` = 8, `rounded-lg` = 12, `rounded-xl` = 16). **Never write
`rounded-[Npx]`.** Every arbitrary radius in the thread (`10px`, `7px`, `5px`, `11px`, `18px`) was
drift, and the same element — a source thumbnail — ended up with three different corners.

> **ENFORCED (2026-07-13):** `src/components/thread/__tests__/radius-scale.test.ts` fails the build
> on an off-scale radius anywhere in `thread/**` or `reading/**`. It walks the tree, so a new card is
> guarded the day it lands. The tokens live in `globals.css` `@theme`, so `rounded-md` really is 8px —
> NOT Tailwind's 6px default. A redesign is exactly where a stray `rounded-[10px]` gets typed and
> never seen; this is the gate that catches it.

**A stacked ladder of equal-weight ALL-CAPS labels is the failure mode.** If a card has four or five
of them, it has no hierarchy and reads as a spec sheet. Promote one thing; collapse the rest into §6.

### 0.5b The honesty spine (do NOT paper over this to make cards match)

The receipt is shared, but **what it claims is not**. Fields we cannot know stay `null`, and the
renderer omits them rather than inventing them:

- **"Proven structure" + the fit glyph (● ◐ ○) are claims RETRIEVAL earns** — an outlier verified
  against a follower baseline, scored against your audience. Grounded hook/idea/script sources have
  this. **A Remix source does not**: the user pasted that video, nothing measured it. So remix passes
  its own eyebrow, and `multiplier` / `baselineLabel` / `fitLabel` are null (`fitLabel` is nullable
  for exactly this reason). It shows the creator, the reach, a link back — and stops.
- **No handle → no receipt.** An unattributable source is not a receipt (`buildProofFromSource`'s gate).
- **Quotes**: components own the typographic marks; model text goes through `stripWrappingQuotes()`
  (`@/lib/utils`) or you get `""doubled quotes""`. Eleven sites do this.
- **Verbatims must not repeat.** Two audiences × one archetype can yield the identical line; the wall
  merges on `(quote, archetype)` and tags BOTH audiences. A focus group that repeats itself
  word-for-word reads as fabricated — see `collectQuotes` in `verbatim-wall.tsx`.
- Bands only (Strong/Mixed/Weak) + fraction. **Never a 0–100 score** — except the video Read's engine
  score, the one place a number is honest.

### 0.6 Compliance status (2026-07-13)

| Card | Block | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Hook | `hook-card` | ✅ **THE BAR.** Copy this. |
| Idea | `idea-card` | ✅ conforms |
| Script | `script-card` | ✅ conforms (has receipt; not re-audited visually) |
| Remix | `remix-card` | ✅ **FIXED 2026-07-13** — was an anonymous thumbnail; now an attributed receipt |
| Profile Read | `profile-read` | ✅ **FIXED 2026-07-13** — was 5 stacked labels + doubled quotes |
| The Read | `multi-audience-read` | ✅ **FIXED 2026-07-13** — had NO card container; wall repeated itself |
| Test / Reading | `reading/**` | 🟡 **AUDITED (structural pass) 2026-07-13.** Radii on-scale + guarded. 🔴 **The "serif quotes" item was a GHOST — there is no `serif`, no `blockquote`, no `&ldquo;` anywhere in `reading/**`.** (The serif is in `audience-lens/AmbientRoom.tsx`, on *headlines* — sanctioned.) REAL finding: `reading-section.tsx`, the section-label primitive every `/analyze` block is built from, still runs the old `10px`/`0.14em` stack. Still unaudited *visually*. |
| Simulate | `reaction-distribution` | 🔴 **STRUCTURAL.** Fraction stated TWICE from two sources that can disagree (`fraction` vs client-recomputed `stopCount/total`) · provenance in the eyebrow · band-word-as-hero · no ProofUnit / no "See the room →" on the room card · 2-row action bar, no cream primary · `text-red-400`. |
| Predict | `prediction-gauge` | 🔴 **STRUCTURAL + OWNER CALL** — renders `~35–60%`, which §0.5b forbids and its own 06-UI-SPEC requires. Also: `band` = Unlikely/Toss-up/Lean/Likely here vs Strong/Mixed/Weak everywhere else. |
| Account Read | `account-read` | 🔴 **STRUCTURAL.** **SIX** stacked equal-weight ALL-CAPS labels (Profile Read was rebuilt at five) · no hero — opens on the creator's *name* · no disclosure · forward action is a text link, not the cream primary. |
| Explore | `outlier-grid` | 🔴 **STRUCTURAL.** The tile has **no card surface** — the only border belongs to the nested `VideoCard`, so multiplier/fit/CTA float on the thread background. Hero = a number. Save sits above the primary. Honest where it counts ✅. |
| Ask | (`SkillResultCard`) | 🟡 **SMALL FIX.** Header is `text-xs`, not the contract eyebrow. Load-bearing (chat + explore thread views). Inherits the markdown bug below. |
| **Markdown** | primitive | ✅ **FIXED 2026-07-13** — was BROKEN, not merely drifted (and rated "low risk"). `prose prose-invert prose-sm` generated **ZERO CSS** (no `@tailwindcss/typography`, no `@plugin`), so Preflight's resets stood: headings computed identical to body, paragraphs lost their gaps, ordered-list **numbers disappeared**. Now rendered by the **`.md` layer in `globals.css`** — our own ~40 lines on the cream tokens, NOT the plugin (`prose-invert` = cold grey, §1.2 forbids). `reading-chat`'s hand-rolled overrides (which forced ordered lists to dots by a second mechanism) are gone too. `ExpertChatThread` left alone — dead code (`CommandBar` is unmounted). |
| **Band** | primitive | 🟡 **SMALL FIX — but it is the SOURCE of the drift.** Band color applied **twice** (word *and* fraction — §1.3 says once) · no dot · its `text-2xl` colored band word is the hero pattern Simulate + Predict both copied. |
| **Personas** | `personas` | 🟡 **SMALL FIX.** Real Lens entry ✅, honest ✅ — but `RoomAvatars` is **hand-copied** from `proof-unit.tsx` (two copies of the flagship cue) · quote styling diverges from `ProofUnit` · Lens target and Show/Hide button share a row (hit-area hazard). |
| **Persona chat** | `persona-chat-turn` | ✅ **CONFORMANT** — contract eyebrow, no fabricated band/score, minimal. ONE question: §2 says the chat language is "no bubble"; this gives the persona a bordered bubble. One of the two is stale (owner call). |

> **Full audit + ranked worklist: `docs/AUDIT-2026-07-13-cards-remaining-nine.md`** (2026-07-13,
> read-only pass). Headline: the primitive rated "low risk" is the only one actually **broken**.
> The other eight drifted; `markdown` never rendered. The honesty spine, notably, is in **better**
> shape than the visual spine — no doubled quotes, no fabricated claims, no off-scale radii found.

⚠️ **§2 below is now partly STALE** — it still describes The Read as painting a legacy coral panel
(stripped) and Remix's real source video as a TODO (shipped). Trust §0.5 + the code.

## 1. The shared refined design language (applies to every card)

1. **Flat matte** — NO inline inset-shine `boxShadow`. Resting cards = border (`white/[0.06]`) + tone only.
   (The `@theme` shadow block explicitly removed white inset shine; the cards re-add it inline — remove it.)
2. **Warm-cream, never cold white** — dim text/labels/rank use the cream scale
   (`--color-foreground-muted` #8a857c), NOT raw `rgba(255,255,255,.3x)` (reads bluish/off-brand).
3. **Single proof unit** — band + fraction + reaction ribbon + lead quote in ONE bordered, hoverable
   block that IS the AudienceLens entry. State the fraction ONCE (kills the duplicated ribbon-label +
   band-row). Band color used ONCE (a dot + the word), never double-applied.
4. **Visible Lens entry** — the proof unit shows reactor avatars + an explicit **"See the room →"** cue.
   (Today the quote is a `LensTrigger` with zero visual affordance — the flagship interaction is invisible.)
5. **Eyebrow kicker** — archetype/context as a quiet uppercase kicker ABOVE the hero line (band-colored
   dot), so the hook/title reads first. Rank/meta to the right.
6. **Why-teaser on the face** — surface the first line of `mechanism`/`whyItFits`; full detail on expand.
7. **One primary action** — the **forward chain step** as a NEUTRAL CREAM button (`--color-action`,
   per design system primary≠accent); Save = icon. Chain map:
   `Ideas →(Develop into hooks)→ Hooks →(Write script)→ Script →(Test full script)→ reaction`; `Remix →(Develop into hooks)`.
   - `Test full script →` (Script card ONLY, the chain's terminal step) = re-run the **whole script**
     through the deeper **SIM-1 Max** test, vs the opener-only Flash read shown above it. "full script",
     NOT "full video" — the uploaded-video read is the separate `/analyze` Read. **Resolved 2026-06-27:
     the hook card carries NO Test-full** — a hook is only an opener, and its handoff sent the same lone
     line already Flash-read, so "full" referred to nothing. Hooks advance via `Write script →` instead.
8. **Zero legacy coral** — no `#FF7F50` / `rgba(255,127,80,…)` anywhere; accent stays terracotta
   `#d97757` at near-zero dosage (liveness only). Monochrome by default; band success/warning/error are
   sanctioned DATA tones (not brand accent).
9. **Vertical-first + platform-aware** — all video media is 9:16 (short-form); every scraped item shows
   its platform via a **monochrome** mark (TikTok note · Instagram camera, `currentColor` — no brand colors).

## 2. Per-card notes

- **Hook** — eyebrow archetype kicker + rank; hero hook; why-teaser; proof unit; expand = seed + delivery;
  primary `Write script →` + Save icon (NO `Test full →` — see §1.7; a hook is only an opener). **Remove
  the dead "If this could flop →" branch** — `predictedFailureMode` is always null (rubric-critic removed
  S5); it never renders.
- **Idea** — kicker "Made for your audience"; "your take" badge (amber = data status); whyItFits folded into
  the why-line; primary `Develop into hooks →`.
- **Script** — opener proof unit labelled "opener only" (honesty spine); beats = quiet bordered rows with
  retention reasoning inline (no per-beat color); primary `Test full script →` (the chain's terminal step —
  deep-tests the whole script on SIM-1 Max vs the opener-only read; "full script", not "full video").
- **Remix** — "Borrowed · {format}" + audience-steer tag as eyebrow; decode anatomy (4 beats) on expand;
  primary `Develop into hooks →`. Show the **real source video** (see §3).
- **The Read (in-thread `multi-audience-read`)** — ⚠️ currently paints a **legacy `#FF7F50` coral panel +
  ✦/◐/△ glyphs** (retired-system remnants) — STRIP both. Monochrome: band = dot+word; the **Lever** (the
  payoff) leads with a neutral cream left-rule + bold. Two-audience compare reads at a glance; verbatim
  "room" kept, tightened. NOTE: the in-thread Read is **STATIC (P9 boundary)** — no live Lens/cloud/chat;
  the "Open in AudienceLens →" action is aspirational (P9/GSI), keep Save for now.
- **Account Read** — profile header (avatar + name + ✓ + follower/like/post counts) + "Read from your last
  N posts" strip of 9:16 covers w/ view counts; two-col working/fix (success/warning data tones); format-mix
  cream bars; accuracy line. Add a forward action `Write to my strengths →` (currently dead-ends) — NEW behavior, needs wiring.
- **Discover/Explore (`outlier-grid`)** — profile-mode header + 9:16 vertical tiles (cover, multiplier
  badge, view count + duration overlay, caption, fit chip). Per-tile platform tag in **niche/mixed mode
  only** (profile mode → header tag covers it). Measured data only (no SIM band/quote — honesty).
- **Video Read (`/analyze`, `reading/**`)** — vertical 9:16 poster + retention-curve overlay + platform tag;
  arc gauge with the **engine 0–100 score** (the ONE place a numeric score is honest) + niche rank; 3 stats
  (watch-through · biggest drop · finish); score-driver bars (Hook/Retention/Shareability); Fix-first +
  hook rewrite; deeper-read accordion; pinned follow-up chat.
- **/chat** — asymmetric bubbles: user = chip flush-right; Numen = flush-left prose (no bubble). Persona
  chat ("Ask them why") reuses this with the persona tag in the speaker row.
- **/test** — concept → proof unit (band + 10-reactor room + "See the room →"); same language as above.

## 3. Data-richness — surface the real Apify scrape ("feel real value")

The profile/video skills should show the real scrape. Inventory (SSOT `src/lib/scraping/types.ts`):

**Available in the scrape TODAY, plumbed to ~zero cards:**
- Profile (`ProfileData`): `avatarUrl`, `displayName`, `bio`, `verified`, `followerCount`, `heartCount`
  (total likes), `videoCount`.
- Per-video (`VideoData`): `caption`, `views/likes/comments/shares/saves`, `hashtags[]`, `durationSeconds`,
  `postedAt`, `mediaUrl` (mp4), `subtitleUrl`.

**Available from Apify but DROPPED:** video **cover/thumbnail** — `shouldDownloadCovers:false` in
`apify-provider.ts` and `remapClockworksVideo` doesn't map clockworks' `videoMeta.coverUrl` (the URL is in
the item already — cheap to add; no extra scrape cost).

**The bottleneck = the block schemas.** `outlier-grid`, `account-read`, `remix-card` carry metrics ONLY —
no avatar, no cover, no profile stats, no video list. **The UI can only render what the block holds.**

## 4. Plumbing required (Tier C — backend, NOT lane/polish — hand to engine/GSI session)

1. Add `coverUrl?: string` to `VideoData`; map `videoMeta.coverUrl` in `remapClockworksVideo`
   (+ `remapApidojo..`). Optionally flip `shouldDownloadCovers` only if hotlinking the URL fails.
2. Add media/profile fields to the block schemas in `src/lib/tools/blocks.ts` (shared SSOT — GSI also
   touches it; coordinate): `outlier-grid` tile → `coverUrl`, `platform`; `account-read` → profile block
   (avatar/name/verified/counts) + analyzed-video list (cover + views); `remix-card` → source video
   (cover, author handle, avatar, metrics, platform).
3. Runners populate the new fields from the scrape.
4. **`platform` field** end-to-end (`VideoData`/`ProfileData`/blocks) — currently absent; the `platform`
   enum exists only in API/audience surfaces.

## 5. Platform / Instagram findings (the "TikTok vs Instagram" gap)

- **Scraping is TikTok-ONLY** (all clockworks/apidojo actors). Instagram analysis isn't wired, though the
  product model anticipates it (`PlatformType = "tiktok"|"instagram"`, DB `instagram_handle`, audience
  platform enum). IG support = a new actor + a `platform` field + classifier support.
- **🔴 Bug (today, design-independent):** `src/lib/discover/classify-input.ts` only matches `@handle` or
  `tiktok.com/@user`. An **`instagram.com/...` URL silently falls through to "niche" mode** → treated as a
  search phrase → broken `/explore` for IG. Fix the classifier to detect platform from the URL/handle.
- Platform indicator treatment = **monochrome** mark (no brand colors, per the LOCKED accent dosage).

## 6. Workstreams (for implementation in a fresh session)

- **Tier A+B (visual + structure) — lane-shippable now, needs no new data:** matte, warm-cream, single
  proof unit, eyebrow, why-teaser, action hierarchy, **remove dead flop branch**, **strip legacy coral from
  the Read**. Edits `thread/*.tsx` (+ the cards' shared template). GSI hasn't touched these; land small.
- **Tier C (data-richness + platform) — backend dependency:** §4 + §5 plumbing in `src/lib/**` (engine/GSI
  session), THEN the card UI consumes the new block fields. Ownership decision deferred (owner call).

## 7. Open decisions (carry into implementation)
- ~~Confirm hook primary = `Write script →` (vs `Test full →`).~~ **RESOLVED 2026-06-27:** hook primary =
  `Write script →`; `Test full →` removed from the hook entirely (a hook is only an opener → "full" was
  meaningless). Test-full survives only on the Script card, renamed `Test full script →` (§1.7).
- Account Read `Write to my strengths →` — net-new forward action; wire to seed Ideas? (product call)
- Tier C plumbing ownership: engine/GSI session vs lane/polish-with-coordination (deferred).
- Platform mark: final icon assets (the sketch uses simplified SVGs).
