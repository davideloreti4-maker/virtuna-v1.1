          direct_prompt: |
            Review this PR as a staff engineer. Focus on:
            1. Correctness — will it work as intended?
            2. Design — does it follow existing patterns in CLAUDE.md?
            3. Simplicity — is there a simpler approach?
            4. Edge cases — what could go wrong?

            After reviewing, if you find learnings that should be recorded:
            - Append actionable notes to CLAUDE.md under the relevant section
            - Keep notes concise: "Always do Y when Z" not "be careful with X"
            - Commit the CLAUDE.md update as part of this review
