## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Light mode landing page | Dark-mode first, consistent with app |
| Video background/autoplay | Performance risk, bandwidth, mobile issues |
| Chat widget / intercom | Not needed at this stage |
| A/B testing infrastructure | Premature optimization |
| Analytics dashboard | Separate concern, not landing page |
| Real testimonials | Placeholder content sufficient for v3.1 |
| Real pricing tiers | Product not priced yet, placeholder sufficient |
| Multi-language / i18n | English-only for v3.1 |
