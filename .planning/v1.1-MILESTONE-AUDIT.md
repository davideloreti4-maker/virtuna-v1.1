## Tech Debt Inventory

### Critical (None)

No critical issues found.

### High Priority

| Item | Location | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| Missing /auth/login route | header.tsx | "Sign in" link broken |

### Medium Priority

| Item | Location | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| Phase 3 VERIFICATION.md | .planning/phases/03-landing-site/ | Documentation gap |
| Phase 5 VERIFICATION.md | .planning/phases/05-society-management/ | Documentation gap |

### Low Priority (Polish)

| Item | Count | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Orphaned components | 3 | TestCreationFlow, FrozenRouter, PageTransition |
| console.log placeholders | 12 | Intentional, documented in plans |
| Mock implementations | 4 | Password change, delete account, feedback, auth |

---

## Orphaned Components

| Component | File | Reason |
|-----------|------|--------|
| TestCreationFlow | components/app/test-creation-flow.tsx | Dashboard implements flow inline |
| FrozenRouter | components/motion/frozen-router.tsx | Page transitions not used |
| PageTransition | components/motion/page-transition.tsx | Page transitions not used |

**Recommendation:** Remove or mark as future enhancement.

---

## Build & Runtime Health

```
npm run build: SUCCESS
TypeScript: No errors
Static pages: 7/7 generated
Console errors: 0
```

**Routes Generated:**
- / (Landing)
- /coming-soon
- /showcase
- /dashboard
- /settings

---

## Recommendations

### Before Completing Milestone

1. **Fix Landing → App Navigation** (2 min)
   - Add `/app/(app)/auth/login/page.tsx` that redirects to `/dashboard`
   - OR change "Sign in" href in header.tsx to `/dashboard`

### Optional (Can Defer to v1.2)

2. Create VERIFICATION.md for Phase 3 (Landing Site)
3. Create VERIFICATION.md for Phase 5 (Society Management)
4. Remove orphaned components
5. Clean up development console.log statements
6. Wire real Supabase auth

---

## Final Assessment

**Milestone Status:** Ready for completion with minor tech debt

**What Works:**
- All 10 phases implemented
- Full test creation → simulation → results flow
- Test history persistence
- Society management
- Settings pages
- Responsive design
- Animation system

**What's Missing:**
- /auth/login route (quick fix)
- 2 phase verifications (documentation only)
- Real Supabase auth (infrastructure ready)

**Verdict:** Milestone v1.1 goals achieved. Tech debt is acceptable for an MVP/prototype. Recommend completing milestone and tracking tech debt for v1.2 backlog.
