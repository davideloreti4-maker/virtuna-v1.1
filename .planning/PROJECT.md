# Virtuna

## What This Is

A social media intelligence platform for TikTok creators. Helps creators predict viral content, discover brand deals, and earn through an affiliate engine. Built as a Next.js application with a Raycast-quality design system (36 components, 100+ tokens, coral #FF7F50 branding). Two-tier SaaS model (Starter/Pro) with Whop payments integration, progressive onboarding, and in-product referral program.

## Core Value

AI-powered content intelligence that tells TikTok creators whether their content will resonate — and connects them to monetization opportunities.

### Active

- [ ] AI viral prediction engine (Gemini Flash + DeepSeek R1)
- [ ] TikTok data pipeline (Apify scraping, trend classification)
- [ ] Real-time trend analysis
- [ ] Trending page with real backend data
- [ ] External brand deal listings from partner brands

### Out of Scope

- Light mode theme variant -- dark-mode first, defer later
- Storybook integration -- showcase sufficient for now
- Mobile native app -- web-first
- TikTok OAuth -- manual @handle input sufficient for MVP
- Sound design -- future polish

## Context

**Current state:** MVP Launch shipped (2026-02-16). All frontend product features complete.
- ~23,170 LOC TypeScript (after 121k lines of dead code cleanup)
- Tech stack: Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript strict, Tailwind CSS v4, Supabase Auth, Whop payments, Recharts, d3-hierarchy, d3-quadtree
- 36 design system components, 100+ tokens (all Raycast-accurate)
- Real auth with middleware enforcement, Google OAuth PKCE
- Progressive onboarding with goal personalization
- Two-tier payments (Starter/Pro) with 7-day trial via Whop
- Referral program with cookie persistence
- Canvas-based hive visualization: 1300+ nodes, 60fps
- Trending page at /trending with TikTok-style video feed
- Deployed to Vercel

**Known issues / blockers before go-live:**
- Whop plan IDs need creation in Whop dashboard
- Referral bonus amount undecided (business decision)
- Whop sandbox never tested end-to-end
- Analyze button routes to /viral-predictor which doesn't exist yet

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Coral #FF7F50 as brand color | Good -- distinctive identity |
| Two-tier token architecture | Good -- clean separation, maintainable |
| Tailwind v4 @theme block | Good -- native CSS variable integration |
| Dark gray tokens in hex (not oklch) | Good -- workaround for Tailwind v4 compilation inaccuracy |
| Custom Select (no Radix Select) | Good -- simpler, full keyboard nav |
| sugar-high for syntax highlighting | Good -- zero client JS |
| React.useId() for InputField IDs | Good -- fixed SSR hydration mismatch |
| accent-foreground: #1a0f0a dark brown | Good -- 7.2:1 AAA contrast on coral |
| gray-500: #848586 for muted text | Good -- 5.4:1 AA contrast on dark bg |
| Inter as sole font | Good -- 1:1 Raycast match |
| GlassPanel zero-config | Good -- consistent Raycast glass |
| Cards use bg-transparent | Good -- matches Raycast live audit |
| Canvas 2D for hive (not SVG) | Good -- 1000+ nodes at 60fps |
| Server actions with useActionState for auth | Good -- simpler than client-side Supabase |
| Middleware redirects to /login (not landing) | Good -- better UX for returning users |
| Deferred response creation for OAuth cookies | Good -- solved cookie persistence through redirects |
| useSubscription hook with polling | Good -- tier refresh without page reload |
| Server-side FeatureGate + client-side TierGate split | Good -- accommodates Next.js server/client boundary |
| Referral cookie set after getUser() | Good -- survives Supabase setAll response re-creation |

## Constraints

- Coral #FF7F50 is the brand color (non-negotiable)
- Dark-mode first (light mode deferred)
- Raycast.com as design reference (except coral)
- WCAG AA minimum for all text/background combinations
- TypeScript strict mode, no `any`
