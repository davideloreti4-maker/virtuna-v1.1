## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [Roadmap]: Mock AuthGuard replacement is critical path -- must complete before onboarding/payments
- [Roadmap]: Hive demo is a separate lightweight component (50 nodes, pre-computed) not reusing interactive HiveCanvas
- [Roadmap]: Referral tables are separate from brand-deal affiliate tables
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 and Phase 2 can run in parallel (Wave 1)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- TikTok developer app approval may block production testing -- submit during Phase 1
- Whop plan IDs need to be created in Whop dashboard before Phase 4
- Referral bonus amount is a business decision (not yet decided)
- Whop sandbox has never been tested end-to-end
