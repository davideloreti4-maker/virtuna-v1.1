## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [Roadmap]: 7 phases derived from 8 requirement categories; ENGINE and TREND run in parallel (Wave 2)
- [Roadmap]: All backend logic in Next.js API routes (no Supabase Edge Functions)
- [Roadmap]: TanStack Query for server state, Zustand unchanged for client state
- [Roadmap]: Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite (not deprecated 2.0 Flash) from day one

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 5.1 inserted after Phase 5: Wire TanStack Query hooks into page components and fix integration gaps (URGENT)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Apify actor data shape needs manual validation before building transforms (Phase 3)
- DeepSeek R1 prompt optimization needs iterative testing (Phase 2)
- Vercel Pro plan required for hourly cron schedules
