# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-26)

**Core value:** A calibrated, interrogable synthetic population you can run any stimulus through and get back a grounded, honest (Validated vs Directional) read.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — engine-pack-seam

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (engine-pack-seam) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 6
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-06-26 -- Plan 01-01 complete (deps restored, green baseline)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 17%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 0 (engine-rework, on `main`): signature substrate (AudienceSignature, 2-model stack, fold↔calibrated-audience unify) is DONE — do NOT `git merge rework/engine-core` (content already landed; merge replays as conflicts/dupes).
- Roadmap: *wrap* the frozen Apollo/virality math as Pack #1's scorer — never refactor it (deep-surgery risk).
- Roadmap: creator (Socials) experience stays byte-identical; generality lives behind the Audience picker.
- Roadmap: the trustworthy-SIM-without-calibration question (vision §7) is sequenced as an early de-risk spike (Phase 2) before the General surface is built.
- Plan 01-01: `package-lock.json` is gitignored + was absent in this worktree → deps resolved fresh from the main-vetted `package.json` ranges (NOT a tracked-lockfile restore). Pre-seam engine baseline GREEN (91 files / 1151 passed + 20 skipped, ~13s); ENGINE_VERSION confirmed pinned 3.20.0. Run engine tests ONLY via `node ./node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run` (npm test/npx vitest emit fake PASS(0)).
- [Phase 01]: Plan 01-02: DomainPack 7-field contract in sibling domain-pack.ts (pure types, import-type only); scoring.run mirrors aggregateScores verbatim; Cut Line A scope lock (no pipeline threading this phase) in header; Task-2 compile-time binding guards contract drift (T-01-RR).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- PACK-04 byte-identical regression lock (Phase 1) is the load-bearing safety gate — must verify creator output unchanged against pre-seam fixtures before proceeding.
- Phase 2 spike must return a go/no-go verdict; a negative verdict reshapes Phases 3–7.

## Deferred Items

v2 scope (tracked, not in this roadmap): SIM marketplace + rev-share flywheel (MKT-*), Anchor Pack #2 / Marketing (PACK2-01), self-calibration Directional→Validated (CAL-01).

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Marketplace | Share/sell SIMs + outcome flywheel | Deferred to v2 | Roadmap creation |
| Anchor Pack | Pack #2 (Marketing) | Deferred to v2 | Roadmap creation |
| Calibration | Self-calibration promotion | Deferred to v2 | Roadmap creation |
