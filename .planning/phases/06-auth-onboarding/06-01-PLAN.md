<objective>
Polish the signup and login pages to brand bible quality with consistent spacing, proper glass card styling, and visual refinement.

Purpose: AUTH-01 and AUTH-02 require both auth pages to be visually polished. The pages are functionally complete but need visual tightening -- consistent widths, proper brand token usage, better spacing rhythm, and subtle ambient visual treatment on the layout.

Output: Polished login-form.tsx, signup-form.tsx, and layout.tsx with brand bible-aligned styling.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Polish onboarding layout with subtle ambient treatment</name>
  <files>src/app/(onboarding)/layout.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update the onboarding layout to add a subtle ambient visual background and improve overall presentation:

1. Add a subtle radial gradient glow behind the centered content area. Use a coral-tinted radial gradient at ~5% opacity positioned center, with pointer-events-none so it doesn't interfere with interactions. This adds depth without overpowering the glass cards.
   ```tsx
   {/* Ambient glow */}
   <div
     className="pointer-events-none fixed inset-0"
     style={{
       background: 'radial-gradient(ellipse 60% 50% at 50% 40%, rgba(255,127,80,0.06) 0%, transparent 70%)',
     }}
   />
   ```

2. Increase the logo link gap from `gap-2` to `gap-2.5` for slightly more breathing room.

3. Add `relative z-10` to the children wrapper area so content sits above the ambient glow.

4. Keep existing: bg-background, min-h-screen, flex centering, px-4. These are correct.

Do NOT change the SVG logo or the "Virtuna" text styling -- these are fine as-is.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `pnpm build` to confirm no TypeScript errors. Visually inspect that the layout compiles and the ambient glow div renders correctly in the markup.</verify>
  <done>Onboarding layout has a subtle coral ambient glow behind content and improved spacing. All auth pages inherit this treatment.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Polish login and signup forms to brand bible quality</name>
  <files>src/app/(onboarding)/login/login-form.tsx, src/app/(onboarding)/signup/signup-form.tsx</files>
  <action>
Apply consistent visual polish to both login and signup forms. Changes must be identical between both forms where applicable:

**Card container (both forms):**
- Change `max-w-sm` (384px) to `max-w-[400px]` for slightly more breathing room with the 3-field signup form
- Change `rounded-xl` to `rounded-[12px]` for explicit brand bible compliance (Tailwind xl = 12px, but explicit is clearer)
- Change `p-8` to `px-8 py-10` for more vertical breathing room in the card
- Keep existing inline styles for glass pattern, backdrop-filter, boxShadow -- they match brand bible exactly

**Heading section (both forms):**
- Change `mb-6` to `mb-8` on the heading wrapper div for more separation between header and form content

**Form section:**
- Keep `space-y-4` on the form -- this is correct rhythm
- Ensure error text `<p>` sits inside the form flow naturally (already does)

**Divider section (both forms):**
- Keep `my-6` divider spacing -- this is balanced

**Footer link text (both forms):**
- Change `mt-6` to `mt-8` on the bottom "Don't have an account?"/"Already have an account?" text for balanced bottom padding

**Login-specific:**
- Message banner: Add a small info icon (Lucide `Info` icon, 14px, text-foreground-secondary) to the left of the message text inside the banner. Wrap content in a flex row with gap-2 and items-start.
- Expired banner: Add a small `Clock` icon (Lucide, 14px, text-foreground-secondary) to the left of the expired text. Same flex treatment.
- Both banners: Change `p-3` to `px-3 py-2.5` for tighter vertical padding. Add `text-sm` to ensure consistent sizing.

**Signup-specific:**
- The password helper text "Must be at least 6 characters" is already handled by InputField's helperText prop -- ensure it renders correctly.
- Keep the client-side password mismatch validation as-is -- it works correctly.

Do NOT change:
- Glass card inline styles (they match brand bible)
- Button variants or sizes (primary/secondary are correct for auth CTAs)
- Google OAuth handler logic
- Form action handlers
- GoogleIcon SVG component (duplicated in both files -- acceptable, not worth abstracting for 2 uses)
  </action>
  <verify>Run `pnpm build` to confirm no TypeScript errors. Check both forms render with updated spacing by reviewing the compiled output for the new class values.</verify>
  <done>Login and signup forms have consistent, polished spacing with identical card treatment, brand-aligned radius, and improved banner UX on login page.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `pnpm build` completes without errors
2. Login form card uses max-w-[400px], rounded-[12px], px-8 py-10
3. Signup form card uses identical dimensions and styling to login
4. Login message/expired banners have icons (Info, Clock)
5. Layout has ambient coral glow with pointer-events-none
6. Both forms still have functional Google OAuth buttons and form submission
7. Navigation links between /login and /signup work (text-accent styling)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- AUTH-01: Signup page visually polished with brand-aligned glass card, proper spacing rhythm, and consistent typography
- AUTH-02: Login page visually polished with matching quality to signup, enhanced info/expired banners with icons
- Both pages share identical card container styling (width, radius, padding, glass treatment)
- No regressions in form functionality (submission, validation, OAuth)
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/06-auth-onboarding/06-01-SUMMARY.md`
