# Plan 60-04: Page Integration & Verification

**Requirement:** Phase 60 integration (all SOCL requirements wired into page)

## What

Integrate all three social proof sections into the marketing home page, verify build, lint, and visual correctness.

## Files

- EDIT `src/app/(marketing)/page.tsx` (add SocialProofStats, TestimonialsSection, LogoCloudSection)
- EDIT `src/components/landing/index.ts` (ensure all exports present)

## Implementation

```tsx
// Page order (below hero, above features):
// 1. LogoCloudSection — immediately below hero (credibility signal)
// 2. SocialProofStats — key metrics with animated counters
// 3. TestimonialsSection — social proof quotes

// Update page.tsx to include new sections in correct order
```

## Verification

- All three sections render on the home page
- Correct visual order: Hero -> LogoCloud -> Stats -> Testimonials -> Features -> ...
- Build passes (`pnpm build`)
- Lint passes (`pnpm lint`)
- No hydration errors in console
- git diff --stat shows only expected files changed
