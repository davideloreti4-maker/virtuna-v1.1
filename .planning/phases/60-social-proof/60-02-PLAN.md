# Plan 60-02: Testimonial Cards Section

**Requirement:** SOCL-02 (Testimonial cards in glass card styling)

## What

Create a `TestimonialsSection` displaying 3 placeholder testimonial cards with avatar, name, role, and quote text using the existing `TestimonialCard` component from `src/components/ui/testimonial-card.tsx`. Cards use glass styling consistent with Raycast aesthetic.

## Files

- CREATE `src/components/landing/testimonials-section.tsx`
- EDIT `src/components/landing/index.ts` (add export)

## Implementation

```tsx
// Uses existing TestimonialCard component from ui/
// Wraps in SectionWrapper for consistent spacing
// Section header: "What people are saying" or similar
// Grid: 3 cards in a row (desktop), 1 per row (mobile)
// StaggerReveal for entrance animation
// One card marked as featured (accent border glow)

const testimonials = [
  {
    quote: "Virtuna completely changed how we approach social media research. The trend detection is incredibly accurate.",
    author: {
      name: "Sarah Chen",
      role: "Head of Research",
      company: "MediaLab",
    },
    featured: false,
  },
  {
    quote: "We went from spending weeks on audience analysis to getting actionable insights in minutes. Game changer.",
    author: {
      name: "Marcus Rivera",
      role: "VP of Marketing",
      company: "Pulse Digital",
    },
    featured: true, // center card, accent glow
  },
  {
    quote: "The dashboard is beautifully designed and the data visualization makes complex trends easy to understand.",
    author: {
      name: "Aisha Patel",
      role: "Data Scientist",
      company: "InsightFlow",
    },
    featured: false,
  },
];
```

## Design

- Section header: `font-display text-3xl md:text-4xl font-[350] text-white` centered
- Subheading: `text-foreground-secondary text-lg` centered
- Cards: Use existing `TestimonialCard` component (already has glass styling, avatar initials, featured variant)
- Grid: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6`
- Center card slightly elevated with `featured` prop (accent glow border)
- Keep text on cards readable (text-foreground on bg-surface, passes contrast)

## Verification

- 3 testimonial cards render correctly with placeholder content
- Featured card has accent glow border
- Cards stack on mobile, 3-col on desktop
- Build passes
- Lint passes
