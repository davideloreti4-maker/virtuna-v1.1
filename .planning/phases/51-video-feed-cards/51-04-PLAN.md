    - "Grid is responsive across desktop (3 cols), tablet (2 cols), and mobile (1 col)"

<objective>
Visually verify the complete video feed and card system in the browser.

Purpose: The VideoCard layout, grid responsiveness, infinite scroll, and hover effects must be verified visually -- these cannot be validated by TypeScript compilation alone.
Output: User confirmation that the trending page meets Raycast-quality visual standard.

  <what-built>Complete video feed with VideoCard components, responsive grid, infinite scroll, and tab filtering</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Open http://localhost:3000/trending in Chrome
2. **Cards render:** Verify VideoCards show portrait thumbnails (from picsum.photos), creator name, handle, relative date, title, category pill, velocity indicator, and view count
3. **Hover effect:** Hover over a card -- it should scale up subtly (1.02x) with spring physics, no jitter
4. **Responsive grid:**
   - Desktop (>1024px): 3 columns
   - Tablet (768-1024px): 2 columns
   - Mobile (<640px): 1 column
5. **Tab switching:** Click each tab (Breaking Out, Trending Now, Rising Again) -- grid should flash skeletons briefly then show filtered videos
6. **Infinite scroll:** If a tab has >6 videos, scroll down -- skeleton cards should appear at the bottom, then load more real cards
7. **Category pills:** Each card shows a colored category pill matching its category
8. **Velocity indicators:** Cards show colored multiplier text (green/coral/blue arrows)
9. **Visual quality:** Overall dark glass aesthetic matches Raycast quality -- no jarring colors, spacing inconsistencies, or broken layouts
