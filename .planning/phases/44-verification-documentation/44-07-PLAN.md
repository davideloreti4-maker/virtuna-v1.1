  <what-built>
Complete Phase 44 deliverables:

**Verification Reports (4 reports):**
1. verification/reports/contrast-audit.md — WCAG AA color contrast audit
2. verification/reports/hardcoded-values.md — Hardcoded values scan with allow-list
3. verification/reports/token-verification.md — Token values vs Phase 39 extraction
4. verification/reports/visual-comparison.md — Visual comparison screenshots + observations
5. verification/reports/responsive-check.md — Responsive behavior at 3 viewports

**Documentation (8 files):**
1. docs/tokens.md — Complete token reference
2. docs/component-index.md — Component index with source/showcase links
3. docs/components.md — Component API documentation (props, variants, examples)
4. docs/usage-guidelines.md — When to use/not use each component
5. docs/accessibility.md — Accessibility requirements (contrast-focused)
6. docs/motion-guidelines.md — Animation patterns and timing
7. docs/design-specs.json — Structured token export for Figma translation
8. docs/contributing.md — Contribution guide

**Brand Bible:**
- BRAND-BIBLE.md at repo root — Complete brand guide linking to all docs
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. **Review BRAND-BIBLE.md** at repo root:
   - Does it accurately represent the Virtuna design system?
   - Are the color usage rules correct?
   - Are the do's and don'ts appropriate?
   - Is the Raycast reference in Internal Notes only?

2. **Review verification reports:**
   - Open verification/reports/contrast-audit.md — any surprising failures?
   - Open verification/reports/hardcoded-values.md — are allow-list justifications reasonable?
   - Open verification/reports/visual-comparison.md — do observations match your visual sense?
   - Open verification/reports/token-verification.md — any unexpected mismatches?

3. **Review documentation:**
   - Spot-check docs/components.md — pick 2-3 components and verify props are accurate
   - Check docs/tokens.md — verify a few token values against globals.css
   - Open docs/component-index.md — verify links point to correct files

4. **Check live showcase still works:**
   - Visit http://localhost:3000/showcase
   - Verify pages load and components render correctly
   - This confirms no code was accidentally modified during the documentation phase

5. **Verify doc links:**
   - All docs/ links in BRAND-BIBLE.md point to real files
   - Component source links in component-index.md are valid
  </how-to-verify>
