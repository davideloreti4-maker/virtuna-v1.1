    Create a clean Coming Soon placeholder page for unbuilt routes.

    **src/app/coming-soon/page.tsx**:
    ```typescript
    import Link from "next/link"
    import { Container } from "@/components/layout/container"
    import { FadeIn } from "@/components/animations"

    export default function ComingSoonPage() {
      return (

                We're working hard to bring you something amazing. Check back soon!

              >
                Back to Home
              </Link>
            </FadeIn>
          </Container>
        </main>

  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    **Setup:**
    1. Run `npm run dev` in the project directory
    2. Open http://localhost:3000 in one browser tab
    3. Open https://societies.io in another browser tab

    **Desktop Verification (1440px+ width):**
    1. Compare Homepage side-by-side:
       - [ ] Header: Logo, nav items, buttons match exactly
       - [ ] Hero: Headline, subheadline, image, CTA match exactly
       - [ ] Features: Layout, icons, text match exactly
       - [ ] Testimonials: Quotes, avatars, layout match exactly
       - [ ] Footer: Links, layout, social icons match exactly

    2. Compare Pricing page (/pricing):
       - [ ] Pricing tiers match exactly (prices, features, styling)
       - [ ] Toggle works if societies.io has one
       - [ ] FAQ section matches if present

    3. Compare About page (/about):
       - [ ] Mission/story section matches exactly
       - [ ] Team section: photos, names, titles match exactly
       - [ ] Values section matches if present

    **Scroll Animation Verification:**
    1. On each page, scroll slowly from top to bottom
       - [ ] Animations trigger at same scroll positions as societies.io
       - [ ] Animation timing matches (not too fast, not too slow)
       - [ ] No jank or stuttering during scroll

    **Mobile Verification (375px width):**
    1. Use DevTools to set viewport to 375px width
       - [ ] Homepage layout matches societies.io mobile
       - [ ] Pricing page layout matches
       - [ ] About page layout matches
       - [ ] Hamburger menu opens/closes correctly
       - [ ] Mobile menu navigation works

    **Navigation Verification:**
    1. Click all nav links in header and footer
       - [ ] Links to built pages work (/, /pricing, /about)
       - [ ] Links to unbuilt pages go to /coming-soon
       - [ ] CTA buttons link to /login or /signup

    **Critical checks:**
    - Typography (fonts, sizes, weights, line-heights)
    - Colors (backgrounds, text, borders, accents)
    - Spacing (padding, margins, gaps)
    - Images (correct images, correct sizes)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
    Type "approved" if all pages match societies.io pixel-perfect.

    If issues found, describe each issue:
    - Page: (home/pricing/about)
    - Section: (hero/features/etc)
    - Issue: (what doesn't match)
  </resume-signal>
</task>
