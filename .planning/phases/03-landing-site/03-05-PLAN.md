  <action>
    Create About page sections matching societies.io exactly.

    First, visit https://societies.io/about and extract:
    - All section types present (hero, mission, team, values, timeline, etc.)
    - Exact content for each section
    - Team member names, titles, photos
    - Company values with icons/descriptions
    - Any timeline/history content
    - Layout and styling for each section

    **About Constants** (src/lib/constants/about.ts):
    Store all about page data:
    ```typescript
    export interface TeamMember {
      name: string
      title: string
      image: string
      bio?: string
      social?: { platform: string; url: string }[]
    }

    export const teamMembers: TeamMember[] = [
      // Extract from societies.io
    ]

    export interface CompanyValue {
      title: string
      description: string
      icon?: string
    }

    export const companyValues: CompanyValue[] = [
      // Extract from societies.io
    ]

    export const missionStatement = "Exact mission from societies.io"
    ```

    **AboutHero** (src/components/landing/about-hero.tsx):
    - Hero section for about page if societies.io has one
    - May include large heading, subtext, background image
    - Use FadeIn or SlideUp for load animation

    **MissionSection** (src/components/landing/mission-section.tsx):
    - Company mission/story content
    - Match exact layout (text, images, quotes)
    - Use ScrollReveal for animation

    **TeamSection** (src/components/landing/team-section.tsx):
    - Grid of team member cards
    - Each card: photo, name, title, optional bio
    - Use StaggeredGrid for scroll animation
    - Match hover states if societies.io has them
    - Download team photos to /public/images/landing/team/

    **ValuesSection** (src/components/landing/values-section.tsx):
    - Company values display
    - Icons or illustrations for each value
    - Match layout (grid, list, cards)
    - Use StaggeredGrid or ScrollReveal

    **TimelineSection** (src/components/landing/timeline-section.tsx):
    - Only create if societies.io has company timeline
    - Vertical or horizontal timeline
    - Match styling exactly
    - Scroll animations for each milestone

    Only create sections that exist on societies.io about page.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - npm run build succeeds
    - All created sections render without errors
    - Team photos load from /public/images/landing/team/
    - Data matches societies.io exactly
  </verify>
  <done>
    All About page sections created matching societies.io exactly.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Assemble About page</name>
  <files>
    src/app/about/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    Create the About page route assembling all sections in correct order.

    **src/app/about/page.tsx**:
    ```typescript
    import { AboutHero } from "@/components/landing/about-hero"
    import { MissionSection } from "@/components/landing/mission-section"
    import { TeamSection } from "@/components/landing/team-section"
    import { ValuesSection } from "@/components/landing/values-section"
    import { TimelineSection } from "@/components/landing/timeline-section"

    export default function AboutPage() {
      return (
        <main className="pt-[header-height]">
          <AboutHero />
          <MissionSection />
          <ValuesSection />
          <TeamSection />
          <TimelineSection />
          {/* Include only sections that exist on societies.io */}
        </main>
      )
    }
    ```

    Order sections exactly as they appear on societies.io about page.

    **Responsive behavior**:
    - Match societies.io about page at all breakpoints
    - Team grid should adjust columns on smaller screens
    - Timeline may switch to vertical on mobile

    **Scroll animations**:
    - Each section should animate on scroll as societies.io does
    - Use appropriate animation components
    - Match timing and triggers
  </action>
  <verify>
    - npm run build succeeds
    - /about route loads correctly
    - All sections display in correct order
    - Responsive at all breakpoints
    - Scroll animations work correctly
  </verify>
  <done>
    About page complete, pixel-perfect match with societies.io including all sections and responsive behavior.
  </done>
</task>
