# Phase 2: Landing Page - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-16
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Polish the landing page so it communicates Virtuna's value clearly with polished visuals, accurate content, and professional presentation. Hero, features, stats, FAQ, CTA, and footer — all working correctly with consistent spacing, typography, and smooth animations. No new pages or capabilities.

## Implementation Decisions

### Hero & value proposition
- Headline angle: **Prediction** — "Know if your content will go viral before you post" direction
- Visual treatment: **Abstract/gradient art** with dark atmospheric visuals and coral accents — Raycast-aligned, no product screenshots
- CTA: **Single primary button** ("Get Started Free" or similar) — no secondary/ghost button
- Subheadline: **Descriptive (2-3 lines)** expanding on the prediction angle with more detail about what Virtuna does

### Features & content accuracy
- Features to highlight: **Prediction + Analytics** only — content performance prediction, virality scoring, engagement analytics
- Do NOT show trending, brand deals, or monetization features on the landing page
- Copy tone: **Direct and bold** — short, confident, no fluff ("Predict virality before you post.")
- Specificity: **Use concrete numbers** — "83% prediction accuracy", "Analyzes 50+ content signals", etc.

### Social proof & stats
- Approach: **Focus on capability, not user counts** — no fake user numbers, no "10,000+ creators"
- Stats section: **Yes, dedicated row of 3-4 capability metrics** (signals analyzed, prediction accuracy, etc.)
- No logo bar, no "as seen in" section — too early
- No testimonials — don't fake social proof, let the product speak

### Page structure & polish
- Section order: **Hero → Stats → Features → FAQ → CTA → Footer**
- Animations: **Subtle fade-ins** on scroll — smooth, not distracting
- Footer: **Minimal** — logo, copyright, 2-3 links (Privacy, Terms, Contact)

### Claude's Discretion
- Feature section layout (cards vs alternating sections vs other)
- FAQ topics and copy (should target what a TikTok creator would actually ask)
- Exact headline and subheadline copy
- Spacing rhythm between sections
- Stats section specific numbers (must be defensible/plausible)
- CTA section design before footer

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Raycast aesthetic: dark, minimal, clean — color only for coral accents
- Stats should feel like capability proof, not vanity metrics
- Bold copy style similar to Linear or Raycast marketing pages — punchy, no fluff
- Avoid aspirational features that don't exist yet in the product

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
