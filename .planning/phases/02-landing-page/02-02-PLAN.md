<objective>
Rewrite FAQ content for TikTok creators, create a dedicated CTA section, and slim down the footer to be minimal and professional.

Purpose: The current FAQ covers pricing tiers and referrals which aren't highlighted on the landing page anymore. The footer has a CTA embedded in it (should be separate) and is heavier than needed. This plan completes the bottom half of the landing page with creator-focused FAQ, a clear call-to-action, and a clean minimal footer.

Output: Rewritten faq-section.tsx, new CTA section component, simplified footer.tsx

    src/components/landing/index.ts

  <action>
**FAQ section (faq-section.tsx):**
Rewrite FAQ items to target what a TikTok creator would actually ask about content prediction. Remove questions about pricing tiers, referral programs, and trial details -- those features aren't highlighted on this page anymore.

Replace with 5-6 questions like:
- "How does Virtuna predict if my content will go viral?" (core question -- explain AI prediction, signal analysis)
- "How accurate are the predictions?" (address the 83% accuracy claim, explain what it means)
- "What kind of content can I test?" (TikTok video concepts, captions, hooks, trends)
- "Do I need a lot of followers for this to work?" (no -- prediction based on content quality, not account size)
- "How fast do I get results?" (< 30 seconds, explain the process)
- "What content signals does Virtuna analyze?" (engagement patterns, hook strength, trend alignment, etc.)

Keep the existing Accordion component (AccordionRoot, AccordionItem, AccordionTrigger, AccordionContent). Keep FadeIn stagger animations. Keep the same section structure (heading + accordion).

Update section heading -- "Common questions" is fine, or use "Questions creators ask" or similar.

Copy tone: Direct, confident, specific. Use concrete numbers where relevant.

**CTA section (cta-section.tsx -- NEW file):**
Create a dedicated CTA section component to sit between FAQ and Footer. This is currently baked into the footer -- extract it as its own section.

Design:
- Full-width section with `py-24` vertical padding
- Centered content, max-w-3xl
- Bold heading: Something like "Ready to predict your next viral hit?" or similar direct copy
- One line of supporting text
- Single primary Button linking to /signup ("Get Started Free")
- Keep it simple -- no secondary button, no fancy visuals
- Use FadeIn for scroll animation
- Add subtle top border (`border-t border-white/[0.06]`) for visual separation

Export from index.ts: Add `export { CTASection } from "./cta-section";`

**Update barrel (index.ts):**
Add CTASection export. Keep all existing exports (some may still be used elsewhere or for backwards compatibility).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx next build` -- no TypeScript errors. Check that FAQ has 5-6 prediction-focused questions, CTA section exists as new component.
  </verify>
  <done>
FAQ rewritten with 5-6 TikTok-creator-focused prediction questions. CTA section created as standalone component with single primary button to /signup. Both exported from barrel file.
  </done>

  <name>Task 2: Slim down footer and wire CTA into page</name>
  <files>
    src/components/layout/footer.tsx
    src/app/(marketing)/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
**Footer (footer.tsx):**
Simplify to minimal footer per locked decisions: logo, copyright, 2-3 links.

Remove the CTA section that's currently embedded in the footer (the "Ready to create smarter?" heading, description, and buttons). That content is now handled by the separate CTASection component.

Keep:
- "Virtuna" logo text
- Copyright: "(c) {currentYear} Virtuna. All rights reserved."
- 2-3 links: Privacy Policy (/coming-soon), Terms of Service (/coming-soon), Contact (mailto:hello@virtuna.io)
- Keep the social icon links (X and Email) as they add professionalism

Layout: Single row on desktop (logo/copyright left, links center, social icons right). Stacked on mobile. Use `border-t border-white/[0.06]` at top for separation. Reduce padding from `py-24` to `py-8` or `py-12` -- it's a footer, not a section.

Remove Phosphor icon imports if no longer needed (but keep X logo and Envelope for social links).

**Page composition (page.tsx):**
Import CTASection from `@/components/landing`. Insert between FAQSection and Footer:

```tsx
<HeroSection />
<StatsSection />
<FeaturesSection />
<FAQSection />
<CTASection />
<Footer />
```

Remove the placeholder comment from 02-01 if it exists. Ensure all imports are clean (no unused imports from removed sections).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx next build` -- no TypeScript errors. Check that:
1. Footer has no CTA content (just logo, copyright, links)
2. CTA section renders between FAQ and Footer
3. Page order is Hero -> Stats -> Features -> FAQ -> CTA -> Footer
4. All footer links work (Privacy, Terms, Contact)
  </verify>
  <done>
Footer slimmed to minimal (logo, copyright, 2-3 links). CTA section wired into page between FAQ and Footer. Complete page flow: Hero -> Stats -> Features -> FAQ -> CTA -> Footer. All links functional.
  </done>
</task>
