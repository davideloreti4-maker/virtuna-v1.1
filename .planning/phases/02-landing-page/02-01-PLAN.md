<objective>
Redesign the hero, stats, and features sections of the landing page with prediction-focused messaging, capability-based stats, and accurate feature representation. Reorder page sections to Hero -> Stats -> Features.

Purpose: The current landing page has aspirational features (trending, referrals, audience insights) that don't accurately represent the product, two CTA buttons where only one is needed, and the wrong section order. This plan aligns the top half of the page with the product's core value: content prediction and analytics.

Output: Redesigned hero-section.tsx, stats-section.tsx, features-section.tsx, and reordered page.tsx

  <name>Task 1: Redesign hero section with prediction angle and single CTA</name>
  <files>src/components/landing/hero-section.tsx</files>
  <action>
Rewrite the hero section with these locked decisions:

**Headline:** Prediction-focused. Current "Know what will go viral before you post" is close -- refine to be punchier and more direct in the Linear/Raycast bold copy style. Keep "viral" as the coral-accented word.

**Subheadline:** Replace current single line with 2-3 descriptive lines that expand on what Virtuna actually does -- AI-powered content prediction, signal analysis, engagement scoring. Be specific, not generic.

**CTA:** Remove the secondary "See pricing" button entirely. Keep ONLY a single primary Button linking to /signup with text "Get Started Free" (or similar per user decision).

**Visual treatment:** Add abstract/gradient atmospheric visual elements behind the hero content. Use CSS gradients with dark tones and coral (#FF7F50) accents. Consider:
- A large radial gradient with coral at low opacity (5-10%) positioned behind/above the text
- A second subtle gradient for depth
- Keep it atmospheric and Raycast-aligned -- no images, no screenshots, no product demos
- Use absolute positioned pseudo-elements or divs with pointer-events-none

**Badge pill:** Update text to focus on prediction capability, not generic "AI-powered content intelligence".

**Spacing/typography:** Keep existing responsive text scale. Ensure `letter-spacing: 0.2px` on body text per brand bible. Remove `font-sans` class where redundant (Inter is already the base font).

Do NOT add animations beyond what FadeIn already provides. Keep the existing FadeIn stagger pattern.

Run `npx next build` -- no TypeScript errors. Visually inspect that only one CTA button exists, headline is prediction-focused, and gradient visuals are present.
  </verify>
  <done>
Hero has single primary CTA to /signup, prediction-focused headline, 2-3 line descriptive subheadline, abstract gradient visual treatment with coral accents, updated badge text.

**Stats section (stats-section.tsx):**
Rewrite stats to focus on capability proof, not vanity metrics. Per locked decisions: 3-4 capability metrics row. Replace current stats with defensible numbers like:
- "50+" content signals analyzed (or similar concrete number)
- "83%" prediction accuracy (per user decision to use concrete numbers)
- "< 30s" time to results (keep this -- it's capability-based)
- "12" engagement dimensions scored (or similar)

Remove "10K+ AI personas simulated" (sounds like a user count) and "3.2x Average engagement lift" (unsubstantiated claim).

Update section heading to be bold/direct. Remove "Built on validated research" -- use something punchier like "Prediction by the numbers" or similar.

Ensure stat values use `text-accent` (coral) and labels use `text-foreground-muted`. Keep the FadeIn stagger animation. Keep the grid layout (2 cols mobile, 4 cols desktop).

**Features section (features-section.tsx):**
Reduce from 4 feature cards to 2-3. Per locked decisions, ONLY show:
1. **Content Prediction** -- AI predicts viral potential before you post. Use concrete numbers ("Analyzes 50+ content signals to predict engagement").
2. **Engagement Analytics** -- Understand exactly how and why content performs. Virality scoring, engagement breakdown.
3. (Optional 3rd) **Signal Analysis** -- What factors drive virality for your niche.

REMOVE: "Trend intelligence", "Referral rewards", "Audience insights" cards. These are either aspirational or not the core value.

Update section heading to be direct/bold. Remove "Why creators choose Virtuna" -- replace with something like "What Virtuna does" or "Predict. Analyze. Create."

Update feature descriptions to be short, confident, with concrete numbers per locked decisions. No fluff.

If going from 4 to 2-3 cards, adjust grid: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` (for 3) or `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2` with `max-w-3xl mx-auto` (for 2).

Update Phosphor icons to match new features (keep ChartLineUp for prediction, use MagnifyingGlass or Gauge for analytics).

**Page composition (page.tsx):**
Reorder to: Hero -> Stats -> Features -> FAQ -> CTA -> Footer.
Remove HiveDemo import and usage.
Remove SocialProofSection import and usage (per locked decision: no testimonials, no fake social proof).
Keep FAQSection and Footer (will be updated in 02-02).
Add a comment `{/* CTA section -- added in 02-02 */}` as placeholder between FAQ and Footer.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx next build` -- no TypeScript errors. Check that page.tsx renders Hero -> Stats -> Features -> FAQ -> Footer (no HiveDemo, no SocialProofSection). Check features section has only prediction/analytics cards.
  </verify>
  <done>
Stats show 3-4 capability metrics with concrete numbers. Features section shows only Prediction + Analytics (2-3 cards). Page order is Hero -> Stats -> Features -> FAQ -> Footer. HiveDemo and SocialProofSection removed from page.
