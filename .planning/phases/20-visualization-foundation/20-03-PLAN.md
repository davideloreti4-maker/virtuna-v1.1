<objective>
User creates the glass orb visualization in Spline's visual editor, designs the materials, animations, and states, then exports for React integration.

Purpose: The glass orb effect requires visual design tools - custom GLSL shaders failed to achieve the quality. Spline provides WYSIWYG glass materials.
Output: Spline scene URL or self-hosted .splinecode file ready for integration.

  <name>Task 1: Create glass orb scene in Spline</name>
  <action>
User creates the glass orb visualization in Spline app (spline.design).

**Reference target:** https://dribbble.com/shots/24801507-Relax-Ai-Motion-Visual

**Starting point options:**
1. [Glass Orb Community Template](https://community.spline.design/file/82165fc2-53fa-49aa-8f4c-ed90880f1a66) - Recommended starting point
2. [Liquid Glass Tutorial](https://spline.design/tutorials/gnhUypBNMc0-creating-liquid-glass-with-spline-in-3d) - Build from scratch

**Required visual elements:**
- Transparent glass outer shell (pink/salmon tint, thin soap-bubble membrane)
- Bright glowing inner core (warm orange/red, clearly visible through shell)
- Strong rim highlight (soft pink/white glow at edges)
- Organic blob morphing (smooth, languid deformation)
- Depth and layers (clear 3D sense, not flat)

**Material settings for glass:**
```
Lighting Mode: Physical
Roughness: 0.05-0.1 (low for glass clarity)
Metalness: 0 (glass is not metallic)
Color: White or slight pink tint
Glass Layer: Enable for refraction
Transmission: High (0.9+)
```

**Animation states to create:**
1. **Idle** - Subtle breathing pulse (2.5 second cycle), slow blob morphing
2. **Hover** - 30% glow boost, slight scale up (1.02x)
3. **Tap** - Quick pulse feedback (optional, nice-to-have)

**Important naming:**
- Name the main orb object "orb" or "Orb" (for click events to work)

**Export instructions:**
1. Click the Export button (top right)
2. Select "Code" -> "React"
3. Choose one:
   - **Option A (Recommended):** Click download icon to get `.splinecode` file
     - Save to `public/spline/orb.splinecode`
   - **Option B:** Copy the CDN URL for the scene
     - Note the URL for later use

**Quality check before export:**
- [ ] Glass effect looks translucent, not solid
- [ ] Inner core glows warmly (orange/red)
- [ ] Rim has soft pink highlight
- [ ] Breathing animation is subtle and smooth
- [ ] No harsh edges or jarring movements
  </action>
  <instructions>
1. Go to https://spline.design and sign in (or create free account)
2. Start from the Glass Orb community template or create new scene
3. Design the orb following the guidelines above
4. Test animations in Spline's preview mode
5. Export using the Code -> React option
6. Either download .splinecode file or copy the scene URL
7. If downloaded, place file at: public/spline/orb.splinecode
8. Provide the scene URL or confirm file placement
  </instructions>
  <resume-signal>
Provide either:
- "Scene URL: https://prod.spline.design/YOUR_SCENE_ID/scene.splinecode"
- "File placed at public/spline/orb.splinecode"
- Or describe any issues encountered
  </resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Spline scene exists (either URL or local file)
2. Visual quality matches reference target
3. Animations are smooth and subtle
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Glass orb scene created in Spline with glass materials
- Idle breathing animation implemented
- Hover state with glow boost
- Scene exported and available for React integration
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/20-visualization-foundation/20-03-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
