# Phase 04 Plan 03: Hooks Surface — Stream Consumer + Thread View + Test Handoff + Rehydration Summary

**Full Hooks surface: live Hook chip (D-09), content-first ranked hook-cards, "Test full →" deep-link handoff into Test tool with hook-as-brief (D-05/D-06, HOOKS-03), open-thread rehydration closing the P3 step-5 debt (D-14/THREAD-07). UAT checkpoint reached — human verification pending.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~30 min
- **Completed:** 2026-06-18 (UAT pending)
- **Tasks:** 3 of 4 automated tasks complete; Task 4 = UAT checkpoint (human-verify)
- **Files created:** 6
- **Files modified:** 4

## Plan-05 Handoff (MANDATORY)

### 1. Test handoff seam shipped

"Test full →" handoff uses **lifted state** (the default seam):

```tsx
// In composer.tsx — the handleTestHook callback:
const handleTestHook = useCallback((hookLine: string, audienceArchetype: string) => {
  setActiveTool("test");
  setTestBrief({ hookLine, audienceArchetype });
}, []);

// Passed to HooksThreadView via onTestHook prop → HookTestContext → HookCardRenderer
```

The brief banner renders above the Test upload affordance:
```
"Shooting this hook — upload your video and SIM-1 Max will score the real thing"
[hookLine in coral] + [audienceArchetype tag]  [✕ dismiss]
```

Phase 05 Test Reframe (D-06) can rename this landing and extend the brief context — the seam is the `testBrief` state + the `handleTestHook` callback in `composer.tsx`.

### 2. GET /api/threads/open contract

```
GET /api/threads/open (authenticated)

200: { messages: [] }                           — no open thread
200: { threadId: string, messages: HydratedMessage[] }  — open thread + D-14 re-validated blocks
401: { error: "Unauthorized" }                  — no session
```

Closes the P3 `persistedBlocks={[]}` TODO — both `IdeasThreadView` and `HooksThreadView` now receive real persisted blocks on reload.

### 3. HookTestContext pattern

```tsx
import { HookTestContext } from '@/lib/hook-test-context';
// Provide from any parent wrapping MessageBlocks:
<HookTestContext.Provider value={(hookLine, audienceArchetype) => { /* handoff */ }}>
  <MessageBlocks body={blocks} />
</HookTestContext.Provider>
// HookCardRenderer reads it automatically — no prop threading needed
```

- `src/components/app/home/__tests__/tool-chips.test.tsx` — updated: Hook chip fires onSelect; only Chat asserts disabled + 1 "coming soon"

## Decisions Made

- **Test handoff seam:** Lifted state (handleTestHook in composer) — preferred default. HookTestContext threads it down to HookCardRenderer without prop drilling through MessageBlocks. Query-param path (for persisted/rehydrated cards) deferred — the context seam covers both streaming and persisted cards (HooksThreadView provides context for both).
- **HookTestContext vs prop:** MessageBlocks only passes `block` to renderers — cannot thread arbitrary callbacks. Context is the correct seam (same pattern as PlatformContext for IdeaCardRenderer's "Develop this →").
- **Rehydration split strategy:** Flatten all blocks across all messages from the open thread → split by type at the composer level. Rationale: IdeasThreadView and HooksThreadView each receive only their block type; the unsupported sentinel pass-through is handled by MessageBlocks itself (D-14).
- **showPlatformChip extended:** Hooks tool shows the platform chip (mirrors Idea) — platform is the first-class param on the hooks request.
- **Upload button hidden for Hooks:** Same rule as Idea — text-only path, upload not applicable.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 2 - Missing] HookTestContext for MessageBlocks pass-through**
- **Found during:** Task 1 implementation
- **Issue:** The plan suggested either a `onTestHook` prop threaded through `HooksThreadView` OR a `PlatformContext`-style seam. `MessageBlocks` only passes `block` to renderers — prop threading is impossible without modifying `MessageBlocks` (architectural change).
- **Fix:** Created `HookTestContext` (mirror of `PlatformContext`) — `HooksThreadView` provides it, `HookCardRenderer` reads it via `useOnTestHook()`. Zero changes to `MessageBlocks`.
- **Files created:** `src/lib/hook-test-context.tsx`
- **Commit:** 0592701c

## Known Stubs

- **`persistedIdeaBlocks` / `persistedHookBlocks` typed as `any[]`:** These are typed loosely at the composer level for now — the MessageBlocks + validateBlock pipeline re-validates them on render (D-14). The types will tighten when the rehydration API response is typed end-to-end (P5 or post-UAT cleanup). Not a functional stub — data flows correctly.
- **UAT Task 4 pending:** The full 7-step flagship spine has not been human-verified yet. This SUMMARY is written at the checkpoint boundary.

## Threat Flags

No new threat surface beyond the plan's threat model:
- T-04-10 applied: `supabase.auth.getUser()` before any DB read in GET /api/threads/open; 401 on absent session; user_id from session only.
- T-04-11 applied: `loadMessages` + `validateBlock` re-validate each block on rehydration; invalid → unsupported sentinel.
- T-04-12 applied: "Test full →" is a UI handoff ONLY — no model API called, no navigation to /analyze, no Max result fabricated.
- T-04-13 applied: Hook composer path never sets `pendingNavRef` / calls `stream.start`.

## Gap-Closure: One-Open-Thread-Per-User Fix (2026-06-18)

### Root Cause

`createOpenThreadLazy(userId)` relied on a 23505 unique-violation to be
idempotent, but no unique constraint existed for open threads
(`type='open', reading_id IS NULL`). The only unique index
(`threads_reading_id_unique_idx`) only covers grounded threads
(`reading_id IS NOT NULL`). Result: every tool generation created a NEW open
thread → ideas, hooks, and /develop messages landed in different threads →
"Hooks queued — check the thread below" showed nothing. Additionally,
`getOpenThread` used bare `.maybeSingle()` which throws PGRST116 when >1 row
matches → GET /api/threads/open returned 500 on reload.

### Changes

**`src/lib/threads/threads.ts` — `getOpenThread` fix (commit 64ba2457)**
- Replaced `.maybeSingle()` with `.order("created_at", { ascending: true }).limit(1).maybeSingle()`
- Canonical open thread = oldest. Safe under both pre-migration (duplicates) and post-migration state.
- Never throws merely because duplicates exist.

**`supabase/migrations/20260618000000_threads_one_open_per_user.sql` (commit 64ba2457)**
- Step 1: Idempotent CTE consolidation — repoints messages from duplicate open threads to canonical (MIN created_at + id tiebreaker), deletes empty duplicates.
- Step 2: `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS threads_open_user_unique_idx ON public.threads (user_id) WHERE type = 'open' AND reading_id IS NULL`
- Consolidation runs before index creation (index would fail if dupes remain).
- Migration NOT applied — orchestrator applies via Supabase MCP.

**`src/lib/threads/__tests__/open-thread.test.ts` — regression tests (commit fd45cc47)**
- `buildChain()` updated to include `order` + `limit` (new query shape).
- New `describe("getOpenThread")` block: 4 tests — duplicate tolerance (does not throw, returns oldest), null on no thread, real-error throw, CR-01 user_id scope.

### Test Results

- Focused suite (open-thread + threads): 12 PASS, 0 FAIL
- Full suite: 2423 PASS, 0 FAIL (+4 new regression tests)

### Follow-on: rehydration render gate (commit 1d21d531)

The dedup migration + `getOpenThread` fix restored the rehydration fetch (`GET
/api/threads/open` → 200 with all consolidated messages), but a third defect
surfaced in live UAT: `showIdeasView`/`showHooksView` in `composer.tsx` gated
the thread views ONLY on live-stream activity (`isStreaming`/streaming blocks/
error), so persisted blocks fetched on mount never mounted their view.

- `src/components/app/home/composer.tsx`: added `persistedIdeaBlocks.length > 0`
  / `persistedHookBlocks.length > 0` to the respective view gates; hoisted the
  `persisted*Blocks` `useState` above the gates (TDZ-safe).
- Live re-verify: after reload, Idea chip renders all persisted idea-cards and
  Hooks chip renders all persisted hook-cards (incl. /develop output). No data loss.

### Live UAT outcome (orchestrator-run, @e2e_creator)

7/7 steps pass after fixes. Steps 1,2,3,5,7 passed first run; Steps 4 (develop
persistence) + 6 (reload rehydration) were fixed by the migration + getOpenThread
+ composer-gate changes above.

**Known UX nuance (non-blocking, follow-up candidate):** rehydration splits the
single chronological open thread into two tool-gated views (idea-cards under the
Idea chip, hook-cards under the Hooks chip); the default Test tool shows nothing
on reload, and in-session "Develop this →" shows "Hooks queued — check the thread
below" while the new hooks render under the Hooks chip rather than inline. Data is
fully persisted and viewable; a unified chronological thread view would polish this.
